Florida Tech Attracts European Space Research Programs (Sources: Orlando Sentinel, Florida Today)

The European Space Agency (ESA) has sent more than 120 scientists, engineers, contractors and technicians to Florida Tech to prepare, monitor and run 16 biology experiments aboard this month's Space Shuttle science mission.
['000329']
The event is co-sponsored by Boeing, Lockheed Martin, United Space Alliance, the National Space Club, and the Economic Development Commission of Florida's Space Coast.
['000329']
Among the ESA experiments: research into how bone cells add or absorb calcium in microgravity (research that applies directly to both osteoporosis and long space travel); how certain infectious bacteria multiply; and the influence of microgravity on radiation damage to DNA in human cells.

*	Because their e-mail accounts aren't permanent and/or reliable, most people would not choose to let government agencies or businesses send them important communications via e-mail 
 
*	If they were receiving vital correspondence via e-mail, termination of their e-mail account would expose them to a risk of not getting some important messages, and require them to notify dozens of government agencies, businesses and other parties of the change 
 
*	The economically underprivileged would especially benefit from a permanent e-mail address - see the Miami Herald article at this link: 
http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/local/states/florida/counties/broward_county/4797915.htm
 
 
*	Universal E-mail Connectivity Would Accelerate Implementation of Your Vision for a More Efficient, Citizen-Sponsored State Government 
 
*	A permanent, reliable, e-mail account would provide the impetus many Floridians need to switch over to receiving important correspondence, such as notices of license renewals, vehicle registrations, property appraisals, tax bills, etc., via e-mail, thereby saving substantial mailing costs 
 
*	If citizens receive communications from government agencies via e-mail, they will be much more likely to use the state portal for the purposes you envision 
 
*	Encounters such as a drivers license renewals are more likely to be completed online if they start online through e-mail-based renewal notices that include a link to the portal site at which drivers licenses may be renewed, and instructions for electronic renewal 
 
*	Similarly, citizens will be more likely to read helpful, relevant information found on the state portal if they are made aware of it via e-mail that includes a link to that information 
 
*	The more transactions that are conducted online through the portal, the more it will spawn even more portal awareness and usage 
 
*	Although we can envision many wonderful uses of universal e-mail connectivity, I 'm convinced that many of the best uses are beyond our imagination right now, and will be identified only after the system is implemented 
 
*	The Challenges are Relatively Modest 
 
*	Spam - could be handled through a no-call list like phone solicitations, or through spam filters that are in use now by e-mail service providers 
 
*	Hacking/viruses/information security - handled the same way as e-mail security is handled by e-mail service providers now 
 
*	Cost - the cost of the equipment and telecom services needed to provide e-mail service is falling; fixed costs of equipment and infrastructure would be spread over so many subscribers that the average cost per account would be very small, and the marginal cost of adding one more e-mail account would be infinitesimal 
 
*	The State could recover much of the cost in savings of paper, handling and postage from e-mailing rather than physical delivery of correspondence with citizens 
 
*	It would be nice to get all of the state, local and federal government agencies and businesses who use the state e-mail platform to pay for that privilege - maybe offer some enhanced services to sending agencies such as electronic return receipts for a fee 
 
*	for state and local governments within Florida, the Legislature could mandate giving Floridians a choice as to whether to receive official correspondence electronically via their Florida e-mail account, and require a small "click charge" be paid by the sending agency to the State's e-mail fund for every e-mail communication 
 
*	Status of e-mail account when people move out of Florida 
 
*	The state could terminate the account, or make former residents pay to keep it active, but I recommend letting our "citizens emeritus" keep their accounts without charge 
 
*	The marginal cost of providing the e-mail address is low, and the cost of enforcing a "citizens only" rule is high 
 
*	It's good branding for the state and its technology vision for a former Floridian living in Virginia to be using his/her Florida e-mail address 
 
*	Other states may follow Florida's lead in offering e-mail service, and Florida would benefit from the use of other state-provided e-mail accounts retained by people who move to Florida 
 
*	Universal e-mail addresses would drive Internet access and usage, especially for the underprivileged, chipping away at the digital divide issue 
 
*	In addition to public libraries, we'd see Internet kiosks at many more places accessible by the underprivileged 
 
*	Other citizens generally already have adequate Internet access at work and at home 
 
With universal e-mail accounts for life, Florida could lead the nation in providing its citizens something that is inexpensive to provide, but very useful for its citizens, and efficient for state government operations as well.
